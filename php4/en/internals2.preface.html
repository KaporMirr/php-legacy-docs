   The Zend API has evolved considerably over time, as PHP has become a more
   robust and widespread language. With the introduction of PHP 5 came the
   Zend Engine 2 (ZE2). ZE2 came with an almost entirely new Object-Oriented
   Programming (OOP) model and a number of improvements in the
   API.

   <p class="simpara">
    This documentation is still under heavy development. The original Zend
    documentation is preserved in its entirety in the
    <a href="internals2.ze1.html" class="link">Zend Engine 1</a> section for those who
    need it before this documentation is completed.
   </p>
  </div>
  
  <p class="simpara">
   This section of the manual is devoted to ZE2. The differences in how 
   extensions are written in ZE1 are small; a short reference to them is 
   given in an appendix to this section.
  </p>
   
  <p class="simpara">
   The documentation in this section is current as of PHP 5.3.3, the most
   recent stable release of PHP 5.3 at the time of this writing. Notable
   differences in the minor PHP 5 releases (5.0 through 5.3) are given as
   appropriate.
